1.6.0 -
	- Feature: Add converters.
	These converters allow annotations to be added to parameters which will automatically convert the argument passed in to that type, if
	possible.

	- Change: Error handlers now take an `exception` param as the second arg. This is the HTTPException, which (should) have the original
	 exception as __cause__ if it's a 500, otherwise just a normal exception.

1.5.5 -
	- Several bugfixes to the underlying HTTP server.
	- Feature: The ability to ignore pre/post hooks in a route with `ignore_hooks=True` in the decorator
	- Feature: Routes can now have the same path, but with different methods allowed.

1.5.1 -
	- Remove hard dependency on libmagic.

1.5.0 - Screw 1.4.0 Edition
	- 1.4.0 was skipped as it sucks
	- Large amounts of the internal codebase was rewritten.
	- Blueprints are now a central part - the internal router now uses them for routing.

1.3.0 -
	- Feature: Per-blueprint error handlers.
	- Feature: Allow ANY method in `@app.route` to allow any method to match.
	- Change: Route now returns a tuple, based on if it could match the method correctly or not.

1.2.0 -
	- Major change: Kyōkai now runs on top of the brilliant Asphalt framework (https://github.com/asphalt-framework).
	 Loading and running Kyōkai is managed by Asphalt, and it allows easier integration with things such as SQLAlchemy.

1.1.1 -
	- Feature: Blueprints. Similar to Flask blueprints.

1.1.0 -
	- Feature: Redirect utility function, which automatically handles redirects.
	- Feature: Session handling in an extension module, uses `itsdangerous` for signing.

1.0.0 - Initial release
