Your First Kyōkai App
=====================

In this tutorial, we'll go through how to write your first Kyōkai app.

Application Skeleton
--------------------

Strap in with your favourite IDE, and create your first new project.
Name it something silly, for example ``my-first-kyokai-project``. The
name doesn't matter, as you probably won't be using it for long.

Directory layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kyōkai projects have a very simple layout.

::

    $ ls --tree

    ├── app.py
    ├── static
    └── templates

There are three components here:

-  ``app.py``

   -  This contains the main code for your app. This can be named
      absolutely anything, but we're naming it ``app`` for simplicity's
      sake.

-  ``templates``

   -  This contains all the templates used for rendering things
      server-side, or for putting your JS stack of doom inside.

-  ``static``

   -  This contains all the static files, such as your five bootstrap
      theme CSS files, or the millions of JS libraries you've included.

Writing the App
---------------

Open up ``app.py`` and add your starting line.

.. code:: python

    from kyoukai import Kyoukai

This imports the Kyōkai application class from the library, allowing you
to create a new object inside your code.

Routes
~~~~~~

Routes in Kyōkai are very simple, and if you have ever used Flask, are
similar in style to Flask routes.

Routes are made up of three parts:

-  The path

   -  This is a **regular expression** that matches the path you want
      your route to handle. This uses standard :mod:`re` syntax. Match
      groups are automatically extracted and passed to your function,
      but that is talked about in a later example.

-  The allowed methods

   -  This is a list, or set, or other iterable, of allowed HTTP/1.1
      methods for the route to handle. If a method (e .g ``GET``) is not
      in the list, the route cannot handle it, and a HTTP 405 error will
      automatically be passed to the client.

-  The route itself

   -  Your route is a coroutine that accepts one argument, by default:
      the client's request object.

   .. code:: python

       async def some_route(request: kyokai.Request): ...

We are going to write a very simple route that returns a
``Hello, world!`` file.

Creating the route
------------------

Routes in Kyōkai are created very similarly to Flask routes: with a
decorator.

.. code:: python

    @app.route("/path", methods=["GET", "POST"])

| As explained above, the route decorator takes a path and a method.
| This route decorator returns a Route class, but this isn't important
  right now.

The Route Coroutine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your route function **must** be a coroutine. As Kyōkai is async,
your code must also be async.

.. code:: python

    @app.route("/")
    async def index(request): ...

Inside our route, we are going to return a string containing the
rendered text from our template.

Templates
~~~~~~~~~

Templates are stored in ``templates/``, obviously. They are partial HTML
code, which can have parts in it replaced using code inside the template
itself, or your view.

The default template engine used by Kyōkai is
`Mako <http://www.makotemplates.org/>`__, but you can change it around
to use `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/>`__ easily.

For now, we will put normal HTML in our file.

Open up ``templates/index.html`` and add the following code to it:

.. code:: html

    It's current year, and you're still using blocking code? Not <em>me!</em>

(note: do not replace current year with the actual current year.)

Save and close the template.

Rendering the template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rendering the template inside your Route is very simple; Kyōkai has a
utility function to render your template.

.. automethod:: kyoukai.app.Kyoukai.render_template

You can add it to your brand new route like so:

.. code:: python

    @app.route("/")
    async def index(request):
        return app.render_template("index.html")

The ``app.render_template`` function automatically loads and renders the template
file specified, and returns the rendered HTML code for you to return.

Responses
---------

Note, how in the previous coroutine, we simply returned a ``str`` in our
route. This is not similar to ``aiohttp`` and the likes who force you to
return a ``Response``. You can return a response object in Kyōkai as
normal, but for convenience sake, you can also return simply a string or
a tuple.

These are transparently converted behind the scenes:

.. code:: python

    r = Response(code=route_result[1] or 200, body=route_result[0], headers=route_result[2] or {})

That is, the first item is converted to your response body, the second
item (or 200 by default) is used as the response code, and the third
code is used as the headers.

.. note::

   All return params except the first is optional, if you do not return a
   Response object.

Running your App
----------------

The ideal way of running a Kyoukai project is through the Asphalt
framework. See `Asphalt usage`_ for more
information on how to use the advanced Asphalt components.

However, Kyoukai includes a built-in way of running the app from
blocking code.

.. code:: python

    app.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=4444)

| The args passed in here are just the default values; they are
  optional.
| Open up your web browser and point it to http://localhost:4444/. If
  you have done this correctly, you should see something like this:

.. figure:: /img/ex1.png
   :alt: example 1

Finishing your project
----------------------

You have completed your first Kyōkai project. For maximum effectiveness,
you must now publish it to GitHub.

.. code:: bash

    $ git init
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:YourName/my-first-kyokai-project.git
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -a -m "Initial commit, look how cool I am!"
    $ git push -u origin master
