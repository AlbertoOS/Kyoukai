# Kyōkai (境界)

## About
*Kyōkai* is a fast asynchronous Python server-side web microframework. It is built upon asyncio and libuv for an 
extremely fast web server.

Kyōkai is Flask inspired; it attempts to be as simple as possible, but without underlying magic to make it confusing.

## Installation

Kyōkai depends heavily on the asyncio library provided by Python3.4+, and certain language features added in Python 3
.5. This means the library is not compatible with code that does not use Python 3.5 or above.

Kyōkai is shipped as a PyPI package, so can be installed easily with pip.

    $ pip install kyokai
    
Alternatively, if you want cutting edge, you can install directly from git.

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/SunDwarf/Kyoukai.git
    
**Note that the Git version is not guarenteed to be stable, at all.**
 
## Getting Started

Kyōkai requires knowledge of asyncio to use effectively. If you understand asyncio, check out the examples:
