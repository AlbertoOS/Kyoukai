"""
A gunicorn (green unicorn) based WSGI wrapper for Kyoukai.

This is similar to the uWSGI wrapper in that it implements a WSGI application for gunicorn to attach to. This only
works with the gaiohttp worker, as otherwise the worker will have to block whilst the event loop runs.

The gaiohttp worker allows asyncio execution of a coroutine (in our case, Kyoukai.process_request), so the asyncio
event loop should work like normal whilst allowing gunicorn to take the brunt of the application work.
